    <h1>Fried chicken</h1>
    <!--title-->
    <p>This fried chicken resupy is the way my mom taught me to make a well seasoned fried checken. It will make your hands dirty, but I think the flavor makes up for it. This resipy doesnt rely on exact mesurements and you can make it in whatever quontoty you want. The only thing you might need to change is the amount of flower and eggs you put in the bowl.</p>

    <h2>instructions</h2>
    <p>The way I cook comes from how my mom taught me to make it. Especaly because there is no one to corect you if you make a mistake, so some of the proses might need extra information. I will put facts that might be helpful at the bottom, but to make this resipy you need to activly make sure you are doing things right. Incorectly cooked chicken could give you food poisining. While I have never goten sick after eating it, there is a chance you will, especaly the first time you try.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season your chicken with salt, pepper, peprika and garlic pouder</li>
        <li>Put flower and crack two eggs into seperate bowls</li>
        <li>mix the egg bowl</li>
        <li>Cover boath sides of the chicken with flower</li>
        <li>Cover boath sides of the chicken with egg</li>
        <li>Cover boath sides of the chiken with flower again</li>
        <li>Fill up a pan with oil. Make sure to use a lot</li>
        <li>Heat the oil untill flower fries when you through it in. If you flick flower into the pan and it floats and doesn't fizzle you know you need to wait longer</li>
        <li>When the oil is ready put the chicken in and cook at slightly under medum heat</li>
        <li>take the chichen out when done. This should be in 8-10 minites each side but it is good to not be dogmatic and cook for as long as you need. If you dont cook at a too high tempiture a good outside is a good indicator for the inside. Dont eat it if it doesn't look fully cooked. The color should not look too consistant or light brown with this method.</li>
    </ol>
